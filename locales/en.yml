      machine_boot_error: |-
        The current Virtual Machine's state is off, though vagrant tried to turn it on,
        this looks like an error with the Hyper-V manager.
      ip_time_out: |-
        The virtual machine did not respond its IP, this looks like an issue with the
        Hyper-V Manager's Integrated service management. Please check the configurations and
        try again.
      no_switches: |-
        There are no virtual switches created for Hyper-V! Please open
        the Hyper-V Manager, go to the "Virtual Switch Manager", and create
        at least one virtual switch.

        A virtual switch is required for Vagrant to create a Hyper-V
        machine that is connected to a network so it can access it.

        For more help, please see the documentation on the Vagrant website
        for Hyper-V.
